This paper presents a full-lifecycle analysis of the Exhibit framework—an end-user tool which provides such functionality—to understand the needs, capabilities, and practices of this class of users. We include interviews, as well as analysis of over 1,800 visualizations and 200,000 web interactions with these visualizations. Our analysis reveals important findings about this user population which generalize to the task of providing better end-user structured content publication tools.",

   "abstract":"Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) took a valuable step towards separating web content from presentation. But HTML pages still contain large amounts of design scaffolding needed to hierarchically layer content for proper presentation. This paper presents Cascading Tree Sheets (CTS), a CSS-like language for separating this presentational HTML from real content. With CTS, authors use standard CSS selectors to describe how to graft presentational scaffolding onto their pure-content HTML. This improved separation of content from presentation enables even naive authors to incorporate rich layouts (including interactive Javascript) into their own pages simply by linking to a tree sheet and adding some class names to their HTML.",

   "abstract":"We present two studies of online ephemerality and anonymity based on the popular discussion board /b/ at 4chan.org: a website with over 7 million users that plays an influential role in Internet culture. Although researchers and practitioners often assume that user identity and data permanence are central tools in the design of online communities, we explore how /b/ succeeds despite being almost entirely anonymous and extremely ephemeral. We begin by describing /b/ and performing a content analysis that suggests the community is dominated by playful exchanges of images and links. Our first study uses a large dataset of more than five million posts to quantify ephemerality in /b/. We find that most threads spend just five seconds on the first page and less than five minutes on the site before expiring. Our second study is an analysis of identity signals on 4chan, finding that over 90% of posts are made by fully anonymous users, with other identity signals adopted and discarded at will. We describe alternative mechanisms that /b/ participants use to establish status and frame their interactions.",

   "abstract":"Asking friends, colleagues, or other trusted people to help answer a question or find information is a familiar and tried-and-true concept.  Widespread use of  online  social networks  has made social information seeking easier, and has provided researchers with  opportunities to better observe this process. In this paper, we  relate question answering to  tie strength, a metric drawn from sociology describing how close a friendship is. We present a study evaluating the role of tie strength in question answers. We used previous research on tie strength in social media to generate tie strength information between participants and their answering friends, and asked them for feedback about the value of answers across several dimensions. While sociological studies have indicated that weak ties are able to provide  better information, our findings are significant in that  weak ties do  not have this effect, and  stronger ties (close friends) provide  a subtle increase in  information that contributes more to participants’ overall knowledge, and is less likely to have been seen before.",

One common way to search the Web is with a search engine. However, it is not always easy for people to find what they are looking for with keyword search, and at times the desired information may not be readily available online. An alternative, facilitated by the rise of social media, is to pose a question to one’s online social network. In this paper, we explore the pros and cons of using a social networking tool to fill an information need, as compared with a search engine. We describe a study in which 12 participants searched the Web while simultaneously posing a question on the same topic to their social network, and we compare the results they found by each method.",

The recent, rapid rise of online social networking tools has made doing this on a large scale easy and efficient. In this paper we explore the phenomenon of using social network status messages to ask questions. We conducted a survey of 624 people, asking them to share the questions they have asked and answered of their online social networks. We present detailed data on the frequency of this type of question asking, the types of questions asked, and  respondents'  motivations for asking their social networks rather than using more traditional search tools like Web search engines. We report on the perceived speed and quality of the answers received, as well as what motivates people to respond to questions seen in their friends' status messages. We then discuss the implications of our findings for the design of next-generation search tools.",

   "abstract":"Web search engines now offer more than ranked results. Queries on topics like weather, definitions, and movies may return  inline  results called  answers  that  can  resolve  a searcher’s information  need  without  any additional interaction.  Despite the  usefulness of answers,  they  are limited to popular  needs  because each  answer type  is manually authored. To extend the reach of answers to thousands of new information needs, we introduce  Tail Answers: a large collection of  direct  answers  that are unpopular individually, but  together  address  a large proportion of search traffic. These answers cover long-tail needs such as the average body temperature for a dog, substitutes for molasses, and the keyboard shortcut for a right-click.  We introduce a combination  of search log mining and paid crowdsourcing techniques to create Tail Answers. A user study with  361  participants suggests that Tail Answers significantly improved  users’  subjective ratings of search quality and  their  ability to solve needs without  clicking through to a result. Our findings suggest that search engines can be extended to directly respond to a large new class of queries.",

   "abstract":"Realtime crowdsourcing research has demonstrated that it is possible to recruit paid crowds within seconds by managing a small, fast-reacting worker pool. Realtime crowds enable crowd-powered systems that respond at interactive speeds: for example, cameras, robots and instant opinion polls. So far, these techniques have mainly been proof-of-concept prototypes: research has not yet attempted to understand how they might work at large scale or optimize their cost/performance trade-offs. In this paper, we use queueing theory to analyze the retainer model for realtime crowdsourcing, in particular its expected wait time and cost to requesters. We provide an algorithm that allows requesters to minimize their cost subject to performance requirements. We then propose and analyze three techniques to improve performance: push notications, shared retainer pools, and precruitment, which involves recalling retainer workers before a task actually arrives. An experimental validation finds that precruited workers begin a task 500 milliseconds after it is posted, delivering results below the one-second cognitive threshold for an end-user to stay in flow.",

   "abstract":"While microblog readers have a wide variety of reactions to the content they see, studies have tended to focus on extremes such as  retweeting  and  unfollowing. To understand the broad continuum of reactions in-between, which are typically not shared publicly,  we designed a website  that collected  the first large corpus of follower ratings on Twitter updates. Using our dataset of over 43,000 voluntary  ratings, we find that nearly 36% of the rated tweets are worth reading, 25% are not, and 39% are middling. These results suggest that users tolerate a large amount of less-desired content in their feeds. We find that users value information sharing and random thoughts above me-oriented or presence updates. We also offer insight into evolving social norms, such as lack of context and misuse of  @mentions and hashtags. We discuss implications for emerging practice and tool design.",

   "type":"Publication",
   "project": "crowdsourcing",
   "abstract":"Interactive systems must respond to user input within seconds. Therefore, to  create realtime crowd-powered interfaces, we need to dramatically lower crowd latency. In this paper, we introduce the use of synchronous crowds for ondemand, realtime crowdsourcing. With synchronous crowds, systems can dynamically adapt tasks by leveraging the fact that workers are present at the same time. We develop techniques that  recruit synchronous crowds in two seconds and use them to  execute complex search tasks  in ten seconds. The first technique, the retainer model, pays workers a small wage to  wait and  respond  quickly  when asked. We offer empirically derived guidelines for a retainer system that is low-cost and produces on-demand crowds in two seconds.  Our second technique,  rapid refinement, observes early signs of agreement in synchronous crowds  and dynamically narrows the search space to focus on promising directions. This approach produces results that, on average, are of  more reliable  quality  and arrive faster than the fastest crowd member working alone. To  explore benefits and limitations of these techniques for interaction, we present three applications:  Adrenaline, a crowdpowered camera where workers quickly filter a short video down to the best single moment for a photo; and Puppeteer and A|B, which examine creative generation tasks, communication with workers, and low-latency voting.",

However, for people trying to understand events by querying services like Twitter, a chronological log of posts makes it very difï¬cult to get a detailed understanding of an event. In this paper, we present TwitInfo, a system for visualizing and summarizing events on Twitter. TwitInfo allows users to browse a large collection of tweets using a timeline-based display that highlights peaks of high tweet activity. A novel streaming algorithm automatically discovers these peaks and labels them meaningfully using text from the tweets. Users can drill down to subevents, and explore further via geolocation, sentiment, and popular URLs. We contribute a recall-normalized aggregate sentiment visualization to produce more honest sentiment overviews. An evaluation of the system revealed that users were able to reconstruct meaningful summaries of events in a small amount of time. An interview with a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist suggested that the system would be especially useful for understanding a long-running event and for identifying eyewitnesses. Quantitatively, our system can identify 80-100% of manually labeled peaks, facilitating a relatively complete view of each event studied.",

It is time that we stop streamlining the process of creating a new application for every schema, and that we instead develop the visual query languages that will let end-users access the full power of relational database management systems from a simple and unified interface.

However, since it is often infeasible to adopt or develop a new database application for any given schema at hand, information workers instead turn to spreadsheets, which lend themselves poorly to schemas requiring multiple related entity sets. In this paper, we propose to reduce the cost-usability gap between spreadsheets and tailor-made relational database applications by extending the spreadsheet paradigm to let the user establish relationships between rows in related worksheets as well as view and navigate the hierarchical cell structure that arises as a result. We present Related Worksheets, a spreadsheet-like prototype application, and evaluate it with a screencast-based user study on 36 Mechanical Turk workers.

   "abstract":"Twitter streams are on overload: active users receive hundreds of items per day, and existing interfaces force us to march through a chronologically-ordered morass to find tweets of interest. We present an approach to organizing a user's own feed into coherently clustered trending topics for more directed exploration. Our Twitter client, called Eddi, groups tweets in a user’s feed into topics mentioned explicitly or implicitly, which users can then browse for items of interest. To implement this topic clustering, we have developed a novel algorithm for discovering topics in short status updates powered by linguistic syntactic transformation and callouts to a search engine. An algorithm evaluation reveals that search engine callots outperform other approaches when they employ simple syntactic transformation and backoff strategies. Active Twitter users evaluated Eddi and found it to be a more efficient and enjoyable way to browse an overwhelming status update feed than the standard chronological interface.",

   "abstract":"It is no surprise that Semantic Web researchers and enthusiasts are excited to publish and accumulate semi-structured data on the Web. Beyond our community, however, we see many authors with structured data who want to publish it in rich browsing interfaces. These small-time authors are similar to early enthusiasts of the Web, simply excited by the opportunity to use a new medium to share information that they care about. For these users, we propose Exhibit, a lightweight structured data publishing framework that duplicates many of the desirable properties that contributed to the original growth of the Web. We argue that appealing to this segment of the Web population---addressing their publishing needs at very low cost---lets us leverage their labor to put structure on content that otherwise would be published in hand-authord HTML, and thus very hard to harvest automatically.",

In this paper, we describe a next-generation personal information assistance engine that lets end-users delegate to it various simple context- and activity-reactive tasks and reminders.  Atomate, treats RSS/ATOM feeds from social networking and life-tracking sites as sensor streams, integrating information from such feeds into a simple unified RDF world model representing people, places and things and their time-varying states and activities. Combined with other information sources on the web, including the user’s online calendar, web-based e-mail client, news feeds and messaging services, To make routine use of the system easy for non-programmers, Atomate provides a constrained-input natural language interface (CNLI) for behavior specification, and a direct-manipulation interface for inspecting and updating its world model."

It is a single web page containing rich structured data, an AJAXy interactive visualizer/editor for that data, and a metaeditor for WYSIWYG editing of the visualizer/editor. Historically, users have been limited to the data schemas, visualizations, and interactions offered by a small number of heavyweight applications. In contrast, Dido encourages and enables the end user to edit (not code) in his or her web browser a distinct ephemeral interaction wrapper for each data collection that is specifically suited to its intended use. Dido's active document metaphor has been explored before but we show how, given today's web infrastructure, it can be deployed in a small self-contained HTML document without touching a web client or server.",

As the video opens, the Great Usability Cataclysm of 2068 has erased all previous knowledge of HCI. The world has been plunged into an age of darkness where terror, fear, and poor usability reign. Unearthing fragments of previously lost archival footage, a disembodied HCI historian (Jonathan Grudin) introduces a first attempt to reconstruct the history of our field. Pioneering systems like NLS and Sketchpad are reviewed alongside more recent work from CHI and related conferences. The results may surprise and perplex as much as they entertain, but most of all, we hope they inspire reflection on the past and future of our field.",

   "abstract":"Information fragmentation is a pervasive problem in personal information management. Even a seemingly simple decision, such as whether to say \"yes\" to a dinner invitation, often depends upon information from several sources---a calendar, a paper flyer, web sites, a previous email conversation, etc. This information is fragmented by the very tools that have been designed to help us manage it. Applications often store their data in their own particular locations and representations, inaccessible to other applications. Consider the information Alex maintains about Brooke. He must keep Brooke's address in his address book, his picture in a photo album, his home page in his web bookmarks, a birthday invitation he is editing with her in his file system, and an appointment with her in his calendar. This fragmentation causes numerous problems. There is no one \"directory\" Alex can use to find all the information about Brooke; nor any way to \"link\" pieces of information about Brooke to each other. Instead, Alex must launch multiple applications and perform numerous repetitive searches for relevant information, to say nothing of deciding which applications to look in. He may change data in one place (a new married name in the address book) and fail to change it elsewhere, leading to inconsistency that makes it even harder to find information (which name does Alex use to search the photo album?). While the computer has fragmented information, it can also be used to put the pieces together again. This chapter surveys some of the ways in which our personal information might be better unified.",
