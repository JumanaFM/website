<P>
As the <tt>HsConfigService</tt> is currently implemented in the most
simplistic functional model possible, some future improvements are
discussed below.  The first major improvement would be in the format
of the configuration file.  This file should allow for added
robustness (in terms of allowed keys and values).  Ideally, services
in Haystack should be able to construct a set of rules for
configuration items they will require.  This rule could then be passed
to the <tt>HsConfigService</tt> and it, in turn, would confirm that
the key/value mappings it has loaded from disk adhere to the
restrictions of the rules.
<P>
An example rule would be (as proposed by the
<tt>HsPersistentObjectService</tt> to the <tt>HsConfigService</tt>):
``Make sure the ObjectStore key exists, and has one textual value.''
Another example may be: ``make sure that key <tt>foo</tt> can be read
as an integer, and that it has one of the following values: 1,5,7.''
Once Haystack has a wide variety of services, the exact scope of the
rules will become evident.  It should then be possible to formulate a
rule language for services.
<P>
Finally, a user interface that allows for changes and explains the
properties of different keys would also be invaluable.
