Now that we have a basic understanding of the document domain, we can
turn again to developing a data model for Haystack.  Abstractly, our
goal is to map what we have learned the document model into usable
data structures.
<P>
When discussing the query model previously (see
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node7.html#searchmodel"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>), we found two components that were part of
every query, the information need, and hints.  Hints were used to
narrow down the results produced by the information system to satisfy
the information need.  In Haystack we would like to be able to handle
three distinct types of hints:
<UL><LI> Hints based on document content<LI> Hints based on document metadata<LI> Hints based on relationship between documents
</UL>
<P>
These hints naturally map to the three components of document state
described previously.  Alternatively, they also map to the three
information system types: information retrieval, databases, and
hypertext, respectively.  Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node25.html#tabmodelrep"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> describes the
relationships between all the models we have described so far.  From
left to right, the models become increasingly concrete.  The document
model represents ideas that will become instantiated in the
<tt>Straw</tt> model we will presently describe.  Our motivation is to
build an efficient and useful implementation that most accurately maps
our abstract models into reality.

Now that we have a goal in mind, it is possible to build a data
structure representing the document model.  We are additionally
interested in developing the data structure within an object-oriented
environment.  We define
<em>objects</em> to be instantiation of a particular class.  A
<em>class</em> is a definition of an object containing both <em>data
members</em> and
<em>methods</em>.  Data members and methods simply correspond to
variables and functions.  Classes can be <em>extended</em> in a
<em>hierarchical</em> fashion, where an extension <em>inherits</em>
certain public data members and methods of its ancestors.
<P>
The Haystack data model is essentially a graph structure where the
nodes (vertices) and ties<A NAME="tex2html20" HREF="footnode.html#519"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> are first-class objects.
First-class implies that an object can be named, exist on its own, and
be passed to, and returned by functions.  Both ties and nodes extend a
specific class.  In adherence to our namesake we call this class
<tt>Straw</tt>.
<tt>Straw</tt> will be discussed in great detail in
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node27.html#ch4HDM"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, but for now regarding <tt>Straw</tt> objects as
nodes will suffice.

<P>
<P>
The graph structure in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node26.html#figstraw1"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> is a possible (but
simplistic) representation of Straws.  This model shows <em>Document</em>
straws connected to a variety of other objects: <em>publisher</em>, <em>title</em>,
<em>author</em>, <em>date</em>, and other documents.  Between straws there are
three types of connections:
<em>inter-document ties</em>, <em>intra-document ties</em>, and <em>term
  ties</em><A NAME="tex2html21" HREF="footnode.html#520"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A>.  Although in the implementation of Haystack
  we don not make these distinctions explictly, this categorization
  will help in the present discussion.
<P>
Intra-document ties represent a mapping to what we have previously
called the external state or metadata of an object.  For example, we
can connect an author node to the document node by means of an
intra-document tie.  To partition different documents we will also
draw a virtual boundry around clusters of straws connected by
intra-document ties and call this a <em>document cluster</em>.  In the
figure we see one central document node for each document cluster.  In
Haystack we call this document node a <tt>HaystackDocument</tt>
object.  The nodes that have some associated data with them we will
call a <tt>Needle</tt>.  For example, we can have an author
node/<tt>Needle</tt> which contains the data ``David'' (with the
obvious implication that David is the author).  We'll return to both
of these objects in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node27.html#ch4HDM"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> when we describe the
implementation of Haystack data model in full.
<P>
Inter-document ties represent associations between different document
clusters.  For example, if one document cites another, we can draw the
<em>cites</em> connection between the two.  Alternatively, if one document is a
web page that links to another, we can use the relation, <em>links
to</em>.  This type of linking represents the hypertext aspect of the
system.
<P>
Finally, term ties allow us to connect terms held within the document
to the document cluster. That is, if the word ``dog'' appears in a
document, we connect a node holding the word dog to to the document by
means of a term tie.  Note that we are not interested in the word
``dog'' alone, but rather the concept of a ``dog.''  The word in the
document may be ``dog'' but the user may remember ``canine'' or
``pooch.''  This implies some semantic understanding of the content of
a term straw.
<P>
With this model, we are now capable of describing documents in a way
that appropriately maps the memory and document models.  We propose
that it is now possible to both describe objects and to query for them
in a powerful manner that is consistent with the way information
exists in the ``real'' world.
