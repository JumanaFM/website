The Haystack architecture can be described in two distinct parts, a
Haystack Data Model (HDM) and a Haystack Service Model (HSM).  The
data model is the means by which we represent the user's information
space, and the services (for the most part) append to or process the
data in some fashion.  This chapter discusses the building blocks of
the Haystack data model.  Specific details on issues such as
persistent storage and object creation will be touched upon briefly
here, but will be discussed fully in Appendix&nbsp;<A HREF="node50.html#ch5"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.
<P>
As described in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node22.html#memory"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> the abstract representation of
the Haystack data model (HDM) is that of a directed graph with first
class edges and vertices. Vertices and edges are typed, and the typing
information provides semantic information about the structure.  For
example, we can have a <tt>bale.HaystackDocument</tt>
<A NAME="tex2html26" HREF="footnode.html#994"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> node attached to a
<tt>needle.Location.URL</tt><A NAME="tex2html27" HREF="footnode.html#995"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> node.  The
<tt>needle.Location.URL</tt> has some content associated with it
(let's say http://web.mit.edu/).  The implication then is that the URL
of this particular <tt>bale.HaystackDocument</tt> is
http://goose.lcs.mit.edu/.  Nodes in Haystack are called
<tt>Straw</tt>s.  All <tt>Straw</tt>s are created with a unique
identifier associated with them (see <tt>HaystackID</tt> below).  The
way to think about this model is in terms of associations.  As
discussed previously, we are attempting to model the same type of
associations that correspond naturally to the document state model.
With the HDM it is then possible to represent both the metadata
associations between objects (i.e. the URL of a document, the author
of a thesis, the date the picture was deleted), as well as the
associations between documents (for example, all the documents that I
cited in this paper).  Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node28.html#figHDM"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> illustrates some of these
relationships.

The HDM sample structure illustrates the use of the three main
<tt>Straw</tt> components: bales, ties, and needles.  Recall the
<tt>Straw</tt> model described in the previous chapter depended on
three types of ties connecting nodes.  In implementing <tt>Straw</tt>s
in Java these tie types are created implicitly by the objects they
connect.  For example, to bind <tt>Straw</tt>s into one document
cluster (i.e. by <em>intra-document ties</em>) a
<tt>bale.HaystackDocument</tt> object is created, and all
<tt>Straw</tt>s associated with the same document cluster are attached
to that <tt>bale.HaystackDocument</tt>.  <em>Inter-document
  ties</em> are created simply by attaching two
<tt>bale.HaystackDocuments</tt> together.  To create the
<em>term ties</em> a <tt>Needle</tt> with text is attached to the
<tt>Bale</tt>.  To review, <tt>Straw</tt> is the fundamental building
block for the HDM.  <tt>Bale</tt>s are collections of <tt>Straw</tt>s.
<tt>Tie</tt>s connect two <tt>Straw</tt>s together, and
<tt>Needle</tt>s have content.
<P>
As stated previously, ties (or as implemented: <tt>Tie</tt>s) are also
first class objects.  Specifically, <tt>Tie</tt>s are an extension of
<tt>Straw</tt>s with a number of extra features (discussed in
section&nbsp;<A HREF="node38.html#TieWeavable"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>).  Additionally, because <tt>Tie</tt>s are
first class, we can apply metadata and relations to links and not just
nodes.  The <tt>tie.Filetype</tt> in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node28.html#figHDM"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> was created
by some service, specifically <em>FileTypeGuessService</em>.  To make
this fact obvious a <tt>tie.Creator</tt> is attached to the
<tt>tie.Filetype</tt> object with the creator's name attached to that.
<P>
It is important to note that all objects are derived from a primary
interface. A Java interfaces contains the method signatures of all
functions that are required to be defined by any class that implements
that interface. The primary HDM interface in Haystack is known
as <tt>haystack.object.Weavable</tt>. All Haystack data objects are
defined within the Java package <tt>haystack.object</tt>. Other
defined interfaces include <tt>TieWeavable</tt>,
<tt>NeedleWeavable</tt>, and <tt>BaleWeavable</tt>. This chapter will
discuss each of these interfaces in turn as well as their basic
implementations.  We will also discuss the model by which we add new
nodes to the HDM.
