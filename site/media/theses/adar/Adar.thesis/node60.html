<H2><A NAME="SECTION001032000000000000000">The <tt>HsDispatcher</tt> Service</A></H2>
 <A NAME="HsDispatcher">&#160;</A>
A full description of the <tt>HsDispatcher</tt> is available
in&nbsp;[<A HREF="node88.html#asdo">6</A>], but a general design overview is provided here.  It is
our intent that the HDM be expanded dynamically by a variety of tools.
Essentially, we would like to implement services that express interest
in some HDM sub-graph and are notified when new instances of the
sub-graph come into existence, or existing instances change.
<P>
We could of course engineer the services to merely listen for any
event in the HDM and then decide whether or not to act on it.
However, this model is highly inefficient for the programmer who must
decide if the object that triggered the event is one of interest.  It
would be much more preferable to describe interest in a sub-graph.  To
facilitate this, Haystack includes the <tt>HsDispatcher</tt> service.
<tt>HsDispatcher</tt> acts as an intermediary between event driven
services and the data model.
<P>
There are two orthogonal aspects of the <tt>HsDispatcher</tt>'s job.
The first is to distinguish between the events triggered in the HDM.
The second is to distinguish between structures in HDM.  Events can be
enumerated (as we do below), but the general graph ismorphism problem
is believed to be NP-hard<A NAME="tex2html43" HREF="footnode.html#1469"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A>.
Therefore, allowing services to express interest in arbitrary graph
structures would prove infeasible.  Rather we concentrate on what we
call star graphs.
