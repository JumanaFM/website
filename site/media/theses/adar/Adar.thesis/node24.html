We are now ready to define a new model for documents, which will be
called the <em>document state model</em>.  A document can be seen as an
entity present at some point in time.  The document as a unit has some
state within that instant of time.  This document will also have some
properties and relations. The properties of the document and its
relationship to other documents can also be seen as units of
information with state.

Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node24.html#figdocstate"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> illustrates this
model of document state.  Some portions of the document state can be
derived automatically, others by semantic interpretation of a user
when reading the document.  We can separate the document state into
three constituent parts (based on properties and relations):
<UL><LI> <em>Internal State:</em> Properties that are of this type generally
  refer to the content or internal representation of the document.
  For example we can say that a document <em>contains</em> the word
  ``apple.''  Generally, things that are part of the internal state of
  the document are properties we can define by looking inside the
  document.  These properties may be non-obvious, and may be derived
  by some semantic understanding of the document<A NAME="tex2html17" HREF="footnode.html#422"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A>.<LI> <em>External State:</em> Properties that can be considered
  meta-data are generally held as part of external state.  The author,
  date of publication, and location are good examples of external state.
  However, it is important to note that properties are not necessarily
  exclusive (i.e. a property can be part of more than one state).  For
  example, the author of a document can be ``David'' by virtue of the
  fact that we know that David wrote it and emailed it to us.  This
  knowledge is part of some external state.  By reading the document
  we can find that it is ``by: David.''  So we have derived an
  authorship relation by semantic understanding, and so the author
  being ``David'' is also part of the internal state.<LI> <em>Relative State:</em> There are a set of fuzzy properties of a
  document that encapsulate relationships between one document and
  another.  One document can cite another or link to it.  These
  relationships can sometimes be derived automatically.  Sometimes,
  however, the relationships are derived based on some semantic
  understanding of a user. This semantic undestanding may be obvious
  to everyone, to a limited group of users, or to the single user
  alone.  For example, one document can be related to another by
  virtue of the fact that the reader read both while eating a
  chocolate ice cream cone.  As stated before, we will place
  non-trivial inter-document properties in this category.
</UL>
<P>
The final important idea to consider is that state of a document may
change.  We will make the claim that documents present state is also a
function of its previous sates.  For example, while a document (call
it <em>myThesis</em>) may have been located on <em>goose.lcs.mit.edu</em>,
it may have subsequently moved to <em>haystack.lcs.mit.edu</em>.  A user
looking for the document <em>myThesis</em> by constraining his search
system to the previous location may come up empty handed if the system
does not remember that the document used to be on
<em>goose.lcs.mit.edu</em>.  Any piece of state that has previously
existed may be of importance to the user who will later look for the
document based on this previous state.  Additionally, the more
expressive an implemented system can be in maintaining all the state
information of a given document, the better it will be able to respond
to user queries.
