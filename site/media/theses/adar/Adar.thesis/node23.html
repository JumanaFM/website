To understand the purpose of this thesis, it is important to
understand the information we are working with.
While we call these objects simply documents, the term is loaded with
meaning.  This chapter, among other things, will discuss the
philosophical (as well as more reality-grounded) aspects of
documents [<A HREF="node88.html#buckland">7</A>].
<P>
There has been much research of the nature of documents, and an all
encompassing study of these definitions is well beyond the scope of
this thesis.  For our purposes we can condense a number of definitions
to give documents following definition: ``A source of information in
any form which is archivable.''  This broad definition applies,
therefore, to all media formats as long as they maintain some sort of
persistence.  It is notable, however, that Haystack functions best on
documents with some <em>text</em> form.
<P>
With this definition of documents it is now possible to explore their
internal nature.  We make the additional argument that documents are
composed of <em>stateful</em> properties and relations.  We can then
leverage this state to represent documents within Haystack in a manner
that allows for improved searches.
