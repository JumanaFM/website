The one important aspect of functionality within Haystack that we have
failed to address is the actual mechanism by which queries are made.
Although there are independent methods to query each information
system there is currently no uniform method to simultaneously query
all of them.
<P>
Ideally, a natural language solution will one day exist that will be
able to dispatch different aspects of the query to different
information systems.  For example, the question, ``What documents
about apples that I read yesterday?'' would be split into two
different questions: ``find me all documents about apple'' and ``find
all documents read yesterday.''  The first question is obviously based
on some semantic considerations and so it will be dispatched to an IR
system.  On the other hand, the other question is inherently a database
type question and can be dispatched to Lore.  Result combination is
also an open issue.  Ideally, the user should be able to scale the
results of the different information systems in some way.
<P>
The second alternative for querying utilizes the Lore DataGuide model.
By taking a snapshot of the current database schema and representing
it graphically a user's can simply fill in different parts of the
graph and the appropriate query will be generated.  A special box can
hold free text queries (those intended for an IR system).
<P>
Regardless of the exact query mechanism, the hybrid-search system
proposed here has the potential to solve a much greater variety of
problems than any independent information system.
