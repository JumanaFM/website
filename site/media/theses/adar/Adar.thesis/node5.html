Given today's tangle of digital information, one of the hardest tasks
for information systems users is finding anything in the mess.  For a
number of well documented reasons including the amazing growth in the
Internet's popularity and the drop in the cost of storage, the amount
of information on the net, as well as on a user's local computer has
increased dramatically in recent years.  Although this readily
available information should be extremely beneficial for computer
users, paradoxically it is now much harder to find anything.
<P>
Many different solutions have been proposed to the general information
seeking task of users, but few if any have addressed the needs of
individuals or have leveraged the benefit of single-user interaction.
The Haystack project is an attempt to answer the needs of the
individual user.  Creating such a system requires solving two
problems.  Half the problem addresses the manipulation of the data
into a queryable format.  Once the user's information is represented
in Haystack, the other half of the problem centers around our desire
to answer the highly varied questions a user may ask about this
information.  In this thesis we will propose a means of representing
information in a robust model within Haystack and we will describe a
corresponding mechanism by which the diverse questions of the
individual can be answered.  This novel method functions by using a
combination of existing information systems.  We will call this
combined system a <em>hybrid-search</em> system.
