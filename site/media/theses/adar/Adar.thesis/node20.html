Over the past two years our research group has worked to implement the
first version of the Haystack personal information repository system
&nbsp;[<A HREF="node88.html#adar">2</A>].  As of August, 1997 the first version, written in Perl,
was released for public review.  The system implemented a number of
our design goals, the most abstract of which was to provide the users
of our system with a repository that implements both intelligent
storage and retrieval of arbitrary data.  Although we are currently
limited to textual representations of the data, anything on the user's
hard drive or on the Internet should be fair game for becoming an
entry in the user's Haystack repository.  A user can easily organize
and find information in their repository at a later time.  To
facilitate these operations, Haystack will make an effort to extract a
textual representation of the data object, object metadata, and allow
users to annotate the object.  In the future, we hope that we will not
need to be reliant on ``textual representations'' and be able query
images or sounds.  However, for the most part, we are dependent on the
technologies of today.
<P>
At a more detailed level, Haystack consists of a number of core modules.
User interface modules (which currently include a personal web server,
command line, and Emacs) provide access to the system.  Textifiers
provide the machinery to extract text from a variety of file formats.
Field finders extract metadata information about a given object.
Finally, Haystack provides modules that interact bi-directionally with
information retrieval (IR) systems.  If any textual information is
derived from the object, Haystack can index this information in any
basic information retrieval system.  We want this abstraction because
different IR systems will represent their data differently and present
different query options to users.  This includes anything from basic
Boolean operations (such as ``all documents that contain 'MIT' and
'Artificial Intelligence' ''), to more complicated relevance ranked
schemes (i.e. ``documents that are most strongly related to MIT and
Artificial Intelligence'').
<P>
As noted above, Haystack extracts both text (through textifiers) and
metadata (through field finders) from data objects it encounters.
Metadata includes anything from the automatically generated checksum
field, to the user generated comment field.
