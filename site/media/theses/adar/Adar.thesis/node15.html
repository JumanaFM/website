Interestingly the first attempt to describe a personal information
assistant described what would later lead to the large body of
hypertext research&nbsp;[<A HREF="node88.html#bush">9</A>].  In his essay, <em>As We May Think</em>,
Vannevar Bush asked his readers to <BLOCKQUOTE> Consider a future
  device for individual use, which is a sort of mechanized private
  file and library. It needs a name, and to coin one at random,
  ``memex'' will do. A memex is a device in which an individual stores
  all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized
  so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It
  is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The memex Bush describes is a mechanical device for building
associations between ``documents.''  Subsequently a number of efforts
were made to produce such as system in the digital domain, most
noteably, Douglas Engelbart's system AUGMENT/NLS (oN Line
System)[<A HREF="node88.html#engelbart">14</A>].  Although both Bush's and Engelbart's visions
were for the inidividual human, Hypertext developed in a different
direction.  Disk space and bandwidth were once a scarce comodities,
and the information systems built tended to have an emphasis on
instituitonal knowledge representation.  To this day, especially with
the advent of the WWW, hypertext systems tend to be used to display
one specific view that is produced by the hypertext creator.  The
associations created between objects generally satisfies the author's
agenda, and not necessarily anything the reader could conceive.
<P>
So what exactly do hypertext systems do for us?  Most systems allow
for the creation of named ``links'' between documents.  These links
imply relationships between the documents that a user may traverse to
get from one document to another.  The claim is that associations
would seem to be more valuable than mere indexing because humans think
in terms of associations&nbsp;[<A HREF="node88.html#bush">9</A>].  Hypertext systems therefore
allow humans to explicitly describe relationships between documents
that may not have been derived by a machine.  In the case where the
hypertext system is in fact entirely text (rather than hypermedia) a
number of proposals [<A HREF="node88.html#adar">2</A>] [<A HREF="node88.html#agosti">4</A>] devise methods for
generating links on-the-fly.
<P>
However, while hypertext systems are good for browsing, on their own,
they are usually ill equipped for searching purposes.
<P>
In summary:
<UL><LI> Hypertext systems are good for explicitly defining connections
  between documents.<LI> Hypertext systems are good for browsing a document corpus from a
  certain perspective.<LI> Hypertext systems would seem to replicate the same type of model
  humans use for remembering.<LI> Hypertext systems are not necessarily useful for easily finding
  things (unless the path is known).
