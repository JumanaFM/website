The major contrast between unstructured and structured search is the
items we are trying to categorize and index.  While the unstructured
IR system concentrates on the act of ``indexing'' across one
dimension (language features), structured systems tend to index across
multiple dimensions.  Traditionally, structured search tools fall
into the domain of database technology.  A very good introduction to
database technologies is&nbsp;[<A HREF="node88.html#date">12</A>].
<P>
What kind of information is structured?  The easiest way to think of
structured information is something one could put in a table.  For
example, if someone had a large compact disk (CD) collection, and
wanted to be able to find certain CDs easily, they might create a
database based on a number of different dimensions: CD title,
performer's name, date released, date purchased, number of songs, song
titles, etc.  In setting up the database, the user would specify the
dimensions<A NAME="tex2html7" HREF="footnode.html#216"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> and the data types of each dimension.  Most
databases provide a number of different data types for indexing.  These
can include, strings, characters, real numbers, integers, and esoteric
multimedia and BLOB types.
<P>
Another way to look at structured search applications is in terms of
<em>metadata</em>.  Metadata, for our purposes, are information about
information.  That is, if the CD in the previous example is the
``information'' we are looking for, the dimensions by which we
categorize the CD (title, performer, etc.) are the metadata. In the
structured search a user generally does not know anything about the
data itself, but understands (or at least has access to) the metadata.
Because databases understand data types, it is possible to formulate
powerful queries on information other than text.  An example of this
type of search is, ``give me all the names of employees who make more
than $30,000 a year.''  Equivalently in SQL, the (S)tructured
database (Q)uery (L)anguage, this could be, ``SELECT name FROM
employees WHERE salary ;<I>SPMgt</I>; 30000.''  Notice that it is now possible
for us to ask questions about numerical values.  Symbols such as the
;<I>SPMgt</I>; sign have a significance when applied to numerical dimensions.
<P>
While it was possible to test cetain mathematical predicates, most
databases are incapable of judging between the semantic similarity of
two items.  For example, while they can tell you that ``1 ;<I>SPMlt</I>; 2'' is
true, they can't decide if ``MIT is near Harvard.''  A notable
exception to this are systems such as VAGUE&nbsp;[<A HREF="node88.html#motro">34</A>] that allow
for extensions to the notion of similarity by allowing additional
domain and rule knowledge to be added to the database schema.
Unfortunately, querying such a system is tedious and requires much
interaction as the system attempts to understand what the user meant.
If we look for an Italian resturant near our house, the system will
try to understand the concept of ``near'' and how important certain
portions of the query are (i.e. is it more important that the
restaurant is ``near'' us, or that it serves Italian food?).
<P>
To take full advantage of database systems a user has to have a very
good understanding of the structure of the search space as well as the
query language.  On the other hand, if the user does understand both
the structure of the data and the structure of the query language,
information can be found in fewer iterations of searching.
<P>
An additional constraint of most database systems is their inability
to extend past their original schema<A NAME="tex2html8" HREF="footnode.html#219"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> definitions.  That is, once a user
describes the dimensions of his data this is more or less set in
stone.
<P>
In summary:
<UL><LI> Database systems are able to generically deal with many data
  types.<LI> Database are good at deciding <em>equallity</em> between queries,<LI> But they have no sense of similarity at the semantic level.<LI> Databases define constrained information spaces (schemes or
  dimensions).
