<p>
Let's look at this system qualitatively for a minute.  We start off
with a data corpus (the <i>d</i><i>a</i><i>t</i><i>a</i> in the figure) which contains some
information the user would like to find.  The first task a user
performs is to combine their information need (i.e. what they are
searching for), with any hints they may have.  For example, if the
user is searching for some document (their information need), they may
also remember that Bob wrote it last year and that it was about
``apples'' (the hints).  The user combines the information need with
the hints to form (possibly just in their minds) some informal
query in <i>Q</i><sub>1</sub>: ``I want the document that Bob wrote last year about
apples.''  Hints are not necessarily directly related to the
information need of the user.  For example, the book a user is looking
for on probability happens to be red.  ``The book is red,'' is a hint
the user can provide to the help the system to find the book.
However, the fact that the book is red has nothing to do with the
information need of the user which can be, ``information on Markov
chains.''
<p>
Ideally, we would like a user to be able to informally phrase the
combination query of information need and hints to the system.
Unfortunately, systems today are incapable of handling arbitrary
natural language queries, so it is necessary for the user to generate
some formal query based on the language specification of the
information system.  This corresponds to the function <i>Q</i><sub>2</sub>. The
previous query might then become (if our information system were a SQL
database), ``SELECT * FROM docbase WHERE author = 'Bob' AND
date <font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> 01/01/97 AND date <font face=symbol> &lt; </font
> 01/01/98 AND topic = 'apples.' ''

<p>
The user then passes this formal query to the information system, <i>I</i>.
The information system in turn generates a set of responses that
satisfy the user's formal query.  If it is capable of doing so, the
system may also rank the responses as to their likelihood of
satisfying the query.  We will get back to this.  This primary result
set is then passed to a post-processing function, <i>F</i>.  This function
acts as an additional level of computation on the initial result set
as specified by the formal query.  The general idea is that sometimes
a user wants a single top matching response, or alternatively
sometimes they want a summarization of all the responses, or possibly
some other representation (sorted by date, for example). In effect, we
generate a new document that reports on the content (or location) of
other documents.  Portions of the formal query that contain
post-processing instructions are passed to <i>F</i> for evaluation.

<p>
Finally, once we have this secondary result set it is necessary to
turn again to the user.  The user must evaluate what was returned by
the system based on their informal query.  If the information
satisfies their need we are done.  Otherwise, the user must form what
we will call <font face=symbol>D</font
> (delta, the mathematical symbol for change).
This <font face=symbol>D</font
> corresponds to some additional restrictions or
modifications the user will apply to his original informal query
function, <i>Q</i><sub>1</sub>.  Let's go back to the initial query for an example.
If Bob wrote many papers last year with a majority being about
``apples'' <em>and</em> ``oranges'' the system will return many matches.
If the user is only interested in the documents that are exclusively
about apples, they will have to revise their query to reflect this
need.  The user can now say that they are interested in, ``all documents
Bob wrote last year about `apples' but not `oranges.' ''  With a new
informal query in hand, the user will now repeat the previous walk
through the system.  What we would like to do is minimize the number
of iterations so that a user gets what they want much more quickly.
However, before discussing our particular solution it would be
valuable to understand how current solutions fit in this model, where
they do the right thing, and where they fail.
