An unstructured search is generally done by users who require some
semantic understanding by the system of the information.  The user may
only have a conceptual understanding (rather than specific knowledge)
of the information they are searching against.  We can also think of
this type of textual search.  Alternatively, we can refer to this type
of search in terms of the tools intended as a solution, the
Information Retrieval (IR) problem.
<P>
An example of this type of search is the case where a user may know,
or at least think, that the words ``Apple pie'' (or some variant)
exist in the object(s) they are looking for.  The user may or may not
have ideas on how to find this particular piece of information.
Regardless, they will generally approach the task in the same manner.
The first step is to start with some textual search engine, and submit
some free-text query.  The query is an indication of what the user
thinks the document should/will contain or more generally, what (s)he
hopes it will contain.  Depending on the quality of the query, the
experience of the user, and the capabilities of the information
retrieval (IR) system, a useful result may be returned to the user.
<P>
IR research has a long history in computer science.  Starting in 1950
with H.P. Luhn's KWIC indexing system[<A HREF="node88.html#lesk">28</A>], researchers have
endevoroued to create computerized retrieval systems for bibliographic
and ``full text'' applications.  A very good general overview of IR
technology is available in [<A HREF="node88.html#rijsbergen">41</A>].  What is both a boon and
a problem for IR systems is the intense efforts made by the research
community to address issues of textual indexing.
<P>
The general idea behind trivial IR systems is the use of an inverted
file index which maps words to their source documents.  Much
experimentation has been done to provide optimal data structures for
this task.  These include anything from hashtables, to B-trees, to
more esoteric structures.  The goal, of course, is to provide an
efficient (i.e. <i>O</i>(1) or some other low order) lookup operation.
When a user issues a query for <i>w</i><i>o</i><i>r</i><i>d</i><sub>1</sub> <font face=symbol>Ç</font
><i>w</i><i>o</i><i>r</i><i>d</i><sub>2</sub>, the IR system
will look up the set of documents containing the word <i>w</i><i>o</i><i>r</i><i>d</i><sub>1</sub> and
then the set of <i>w</i><i>o</i><i>r</i><i>d</i><sub>2</sub>, and find the intersection of the two sets.
This type of fairly simplistic IR system is called a boolean IR
system.  Boolean systems generally have a number of operators based on
their namesake, Boolean logic (i.e. AND, OR, NOT, etc.).
<P>
Other systems, which are of more interest to us, are the ``fuzzy'' IR
systems.  A fairly simple example is a boolean system with ranking.
Essentially, when the IR system evaluates the boolean query, it will
rank the returned documents based on the number of conditionals the
document satisfies.  A much more powerful ranking system is the
vector-based IR system.  In very simple terms, documents are projected
into <I>n</I>-dimensional<A NAME="tex2html9" HREF="footnode.html#231"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> vector space.  When a query is issued a vector
corresponding to the query terms is created and thrown into the
document vector space.  The IR system then uses a metric (typically
the inner product) to find the vectors that are the closest to the
query vector.  The theory behind this approach is that documents with
high co-occurence of words cluster together, and queries that share
terms with those documents imply that the documents are related to the
query.  The exact methodology for this approach is not necessarily the
driving factor for it's discussion.  Rather, the general concept, that
IR systems produce fuzzy matches is of greatest importance.  IR
systems, being oriented towards the indexing language features, have
evolved to capture semantic information about documents.
<P>
IR systems are judged by a <em>precision-recall</em> metric.
<em>Precision</em> is simply:
<P>
<center>  [The number of correct answers returned/ The total number of answers returned]
</center>
<P>
<em>Recall</em> is defined as:
<P>
<center>  [The number of correct answers returned/ The number of correct answers in the system].
</center>
<P>
<em>Correct</em> implies that something, or more
precisely someone, has made the judgment that a certain document
matches a certain query.  A human will inevitably have a different
view of ``correctness'' of a certain document based on a semantic
understanding of the material.  It is therefore necessary for IR
systems to contain the ability to work ``fuzzily'' in a way that
creates some semantic, rather than purely syntactic, understanding.
<P>
The semantic information derived by IR systems is by no means
``intelligent.''  For the most part it has some statistical basis or
was derived by some rule based heuristic.  Statistical mechanisms
include the elimination of low entropy words (i.e. words that are not
useful in distinguishing between documents).  Heuristic methods
include the removal of pre-set, common words (these are called
stopwords).  Additionally, IR systems have been developed that provide
relevance feedback and machine learning functionality that allow the
system to improve its results over time.  These algorithms create the
appearance of semantic understanding by observing human operation.  In
the rule based algorithm tool kit, IR systems hold thesauri (for
indexing not only the word, but its synonyms) and stemming algorithms
(for breaking a word down into its root and indexing by the root).
<P>
The unfortunate side effect of complex IR system behavior is the
inability to handle certain queries.  For example, what can we do if
we wanted to index a document by additional features such as author,
or date?  We can of course <em>emulate</em> this behavior to some
extent.  We can place the phrases ``author: David'' and ``date:
01/01/99'' at the beginning (or end) of the document, and allow the IR
system to index the terms.  Furthermore if we wanted to have one
document imply a relation to another, say a citation to a document
name <em>document1</em>, we can add the text ``cites: document1.''
<P>
We call the concept of implementing one information system on top of
another (in this case database and hypertext on top of IR) an
<em>emulation</em> system.  When we want to find all papers written by
David about ``oranges'' we could make the query: ``'author: David'
<em>AND</em> 'oranges'.'' The IR system (assuming it is capable of
finding phrases and not just words) will quite possibly return the
right thing.  Such a query works for the reason that an IR system is
capable of matching text to text.  However, what happens when we want
to find all documents about oranges written between 12/15/98 and
1/13/99?  We are no longer able postulate such a query.  Even though
the IR system can provide us with fuzzy answers, these are fuzzy in
terms of text and not numerical values. Searching against different
data types is not a forte of IR systems.
<P>
In summary:
<UL><LI> IR systems are oriented towards language features<LI> IR systems have a refined sense of similarity between queries
  and text documents (i.e. they have some sense of language
  semantics).<LI> IR algorithms are optimized for text indexing.<LI> IR system responses are fuzzy.  They return <em>probable</em>
  matches based on some heuristic.
