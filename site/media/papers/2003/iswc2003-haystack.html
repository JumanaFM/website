    <b>
    <p>Abstract.</b> The Semantic Web promises to open 
    innumerable opportunities for automation and information retrieval by 
    standardizing the protocols for metadata exchange. However, just as the 
    success of the World Wide Web can be attributed to the ease of use and 
    ubiquity of Web browsers, we believe that the unfolding of the Semantic Web 
    vision depends on users getting powerful but easy-to-use tools for managing 
    their information. But unlike HTML, which can be easily edited in any text 
    editor, RDF is more complicated to author and does not have an obvious 
    presentation mechanism. Previous work has concentrated on the ideas of 
    generic RDF graph visualization and RDF Schema-based form generation. In 
    this paper, we present a comprehensive platform for constructing end user 
    applications that create, manipulate, and visualize arbitrary RDF-encoded 
    information, adding another layer to the abstraction cake. We discuss a 
    programming environment specifically designed for manipulating RDF and 
    introduce user interface concepts on top that allow the developer to quickly 
    assemble applications that are based on RDF data models. Also, because user 
    interface specifications and program logic are themselves describable in RDF, 
    applications built upon our framework enjoy properties such as network 
    updatability, extensibility, and end user customizability—all desirable 
    characteristics in the spirit of the Semantic Web.</p>
