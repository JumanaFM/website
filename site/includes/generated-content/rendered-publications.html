                        <div class="abstract"><span>Microblogs are a tremendous repository of user-generated content about world events. However, for people trying to understand events by querying services like Twitter, a chronological log of posts makes it very difﬁcult to get a detailed understanding of an event. In this paper, we present TwitInfo, a system for visualizing and summarizing events on Twitter. TwitInfo allows users to browse a large collection of tweets using a timeline-based display that highlights peaks of high tweet activity. A novel streaming algorithm automatically discovers these peaks and labels them meaningfully using text from the tweets. Users can drill down to subevents, and explore further via geolocation, sentiment, and popular URLs. We contribute a recall-normalized aggregate sentiment visualization to produce more honest sentiment overviews. An evaluation of the system revealed that users were able to reconstruct meaningful summaries of events in a small amount of time. An interview with a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist suggested that the system would be especially useful for understanding a long-running event and for identifying eyewitnesses. Quantitatively, our system can identify 80-100% of manually labeled peaks, facilitating a relatively complete view of each event studied.</span></div>

However, the number of papers designing and building new     sociotechnical systems has not kept pace. We analyze challenges facing social computing systems research, ranging from misaligned methodological incentives, evaluation expectations, double standards, and relevance compared to industry. We suggest improvements for the community to consider so that we can chart the future of our field.</span></div>

                        <div class="abstract"><span>If you have ever encountered a piece of highly domain-specific business software, you may have noticed that it was largely a graphical front-end to some relational database. You may also, in fact, have avoided using the system at all--studies show that information workers prefer to dump their data into spreadsheets, a general and more familiar tool which, unfortunately, is poorly suited for many standard database tasks. It is time that we stop streamlining the process of creating a new application for every schema, and that we instead develop the visual query languages that will let end-users access the full power of relational database management systems from a simple and unified interface. Once information workers can create, manage, and query real databases with the same ease as they routinely manipulate spreadsheets today, they will never return to their schema-dependent, consultant-made, and oddly-colored Microsoft Access applications.</span></div>

                        <div class="abstract"><span>A key feature of relational database applications is managing "plural" relationships--one-to-many and many-to-many--between entities. However, since it is often infeasible to adopt or develop a new database application for any given schema at hand, information workers instead turn to spreadsheets, which lend themselves poorly to schemas requiring multiple related entity sets. In this paper, we propose to reduce the cost-usability gap between spreadsheets and tailor-made relational database applications by extending the spreadsheet paradigm to let the user establish relationships between rows in related worksheets as well as view and navigate the hierarchical cell structure that arises as a result. We present Related Worksheets, a spreadsheet-like prototype application, and evaluate it with a screencast-based user study on 36 Mechanical Turk workers. First-time users of our software were able to solve lookup-type query tasks with the same or higher accuracy as subjects using Microsoft Excel, in one case 40% faster on average.</span></div>

                        <div class="abstract"><span>This paper introduces architectural and interaction patterns for integrating crowdsourced human contributions directly into user interfaces. We focus on writing and editing, com-plex endeavors that span many levels of conceptual and pragmatic activity. Authoring tools offer help with prag-matics, but for higher-level help, writers commonly turn to other people. We thus present Soylent, a word processing interface that enables writers to call on Mechanical Turk workers to shorten, proofread, and otherwise edit parts of their documents on demand. To improve worker quality, we introduce the Find-Fix-Verify crowd programming pat-tern, which splits tasks into a series of generation and re-view stages. Evaluation studies demonstrate the feasibility of crowdsourced editing and investigate questions of relia-bility, cost, wait time, and work time for edits.</span></div>
